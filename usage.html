	   <h2> Haskell Usage </h2>
	   <h3> Modern Usage: </h3>
	     <p> Haskell is used for solving math problems. It is powerful tool for mathematicians.
	         Following are some of the examples in math area:
		  -- Finding out the solution to the complex problem
		  -- Testing some hypothesis
		  -- Building the mathematics formulae
	     </p>
	   <h3> Compiling & Building </h3>
	     <p> In order to compile the Haskell program you can either run in web browser or you can use the program called GHCI.
	         This is the native program for the Haskell language.
	     </p>
