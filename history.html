                In September of 1987, an impromptu meeting was held by individuals on Functional Programming Languages and Computer Architecture (nicknamed FCPA '87). During this time, several functional programming languages had emerged within the industry, however the attendees of the conference felt most of the over a dozen new functional programming languages being released were in fact detrimental to increasing the popularity and widespread use of functional programming languages.
                <br><br>
                Attendees of the conference felt the creation of a single, common functional programming language was essential for increasing the use of these types of functional programming languages. The result of this meeting was the functional programming language Haskell, as well as the formation of its committee. Although at the end of this meeting no official name was created for this new programming language, and very few technical aspects or decisions had been made. 
                <br><br>
                The following year in January of 1988, a second meeting was held at Yale where further discussions of this new functional programming language took place. It was also at this point that the name Haskell was decided, taking after the logician named Haskell B. Curry, who's work provided the foundation that Haskell is built upon.<br><br>
                Haskell 1.0 was released on April 1st of 1990, with several subsequent releases following over the course of the next few decades.
